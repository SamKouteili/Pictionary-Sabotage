# Pictionary Sabotage
Team: Gabriel, Alvin, Jachym, Sam, Tram
The game of pictionary sabotage would start with a drawer, guesser/guessers, and a saboteur. The drawer and guesser(s) would be in the same team, aiming to gain points by the guesser guessing the word correctly within the time limit provided. On the other hand, the sabotager will be on the opposite team, gaining points if the guesser was not able to guess the word correctly. The sabotager will be given intervals of time, such as 3 seconds, to erase the drawing as the drawer is drawing it.
